I met with my team one day and found out that my team leader thinks that arrays start at 
one and that crocs are our civilization's greatest mistake. I immidiately knew that my group
was about to enter the storming phase. So I teamed up with Mr.IListenToMusicOnSpeakersInTheCSLab (Nick)
to battle the team leader. The battle rages on. #eyeofthestorm.
