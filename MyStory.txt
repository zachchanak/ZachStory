I met with my team one day and found out that my team leader thinks that arrays start at 
one and that crocs are our civilization's greatest mistake. I immidiately knew that my group
was about to enter the storming phase. So I teamed up with Mr.IListenToMusicOnSpeakersInTheCSLab (Nick)
to battle the team leader. The battle rages on. #eyeofthestorm.

Breaking news, Mr.IListenToMusicOnSpeakersInTheCSLab (its actually Michael... not nick. god sanj what
a team leader doesnt even know our names.) actually is still listening to music over his speakers,
because it actually gives a better soundstage for the music. Pfft. Who doesn't know that? Currently
the team is struggling to make it out of the storming phase, and the clashing has become increasingly 
intense. We will fight to the death. #thestormrageson

The battle takes a turn for the worse as MrIListenToMusicOnSpeakersInTheCSLab gets kicked out of the computer science labs. Nick has left in exasperation, and I realized that our team leader is doing her best to keep the group together. #stormwho?
